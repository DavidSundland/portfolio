David Sundland Portfolio

## Background

I built this app to provide a quick overview of my coding background and skills.  Live site available at: http://www.fullstackdeveloper.pro/

## User Story
This app gives users a short bio about myself and a summary of my coding skills and recent apps.  It provides links to some of my larger projects, including links to live versions of the apps and the underlying code.

As a user, I want to land on the website and quickly gain an understanding of David Sundland.

The main page:
* The site is a simple, single-page app.  Navigation links jump to different sections of the page.
* The user sees a navigation bar, a hero image and slogan, an "About Me" section, a "Skills" section, and a "Projects" section, with a footer that includes contact links.
* Coding skills are listed both in the "Skills" section and, as pertinent, under each project.
* The "Projects" section includes screenshots of each app, an overview of the app, a list of skills used, and links to the code and a demo.
* The footer provides links to e-mail and my accounts on GitHub, LinkedIn, AngelList, and CodeWars.
